Zealux, as a library focused on creating a system to execute a **Processor Pipeline**, can be described as follows:

**Zealux** provides a streamlined, modular framework to manage and execute **Processor Pipelines**—sequences of computational steps or tasks executed systematically to process data or events. It allows developers to define, connect, and orchestrate individual processors into efficient workflows, supporting clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

### Core Concepts:

1. **Processor**:
   Individual computational unit responsible for a specific, well-defined operation (e.g., parsing data, validating inputs, transforming records).

2. **Pipeline**:
   A structured sequence or graph of processors, allowing data or events to flow through multiple processing stages seamlessly.

3. **Execution Engine**:
   Manages the lifecycle of processors within a pipeline, coordinating initialization, execution order, concurrency, error handling, and resource management.

4. **Pipeline Definition**:
   Clear, configurable declarations for how processors interact, ensuring pipelines are easy to define, understand, modify, and debug.

### Why Zealux?

* **Modularity**: Easy plug-and-play processors to extend or modify pipeline behavior.
* **Robustness**: Handles complex execution scenarios with built-in error handling and resource management.
* **Scalability**: Designed for high performance, enabling parallel execution and efficient handling of large-scale processing.
* **Developer-friendly**: Clean, intuitive APIs for building and managing pipelines.

This architecture makes **Zealux** ideal for applications like data transformation, event handling, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, middleware orchestration, and automation workflows—anywhere a structured pipeline execution model is advantageous.
